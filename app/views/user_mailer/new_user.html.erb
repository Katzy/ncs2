      <p>
        The NCS seeding meeting in this Sunday and League tournaments are already underway.  To streamline the entry process, we have upgraded the online site to list your league entries.  League Reps will enter in all of the league placers plus any other additioal wrestler data provided to them by their league.

      <p>
        All coaches receiving this email have an ID to access the site and EDIT / ENTER SEEDING INFORMATION on their specific wrestlers only.  HOWEVER, ONLY LEAGUE REPS CAN ADD OR DELETE WRESTLERS.
